Task 2
Mandatory task: Create a Dictionary, where key will represent the surname of the student and value will represent his mark for the exam (1 to 5).
You can add items to dictionary from keyboard or predetermine them in code (choose what you like more). If you’re entering values from keyboard, you should receive a message if input has wrong format (e.g. user entered a mark that’s not a number or that’s not within [1,5] range) and be given a possibility to enter another value.
When you finished entering items to Dictionary, you should be told to enter a surname of the student.
Program should output student and his mark (please refer to screenshot) if this student is present. Otherwise, you should show a message that student does not exist.

Optional Task 2* - If you input value for a mark (e.g. 3), you should see all surnames of the students who got this mark. 

Please look at TryGetValue() and ContainsKey() methods to implement this task.
